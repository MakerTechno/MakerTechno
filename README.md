## Personal description

I am a maker, constantly **exploring** and **creating** new things.

My **passion** for innovation drives me to experiment with various technologies and tools, turning ideas into **reality**.

Whether it's building electronic circuits, developing software, or crafting unique projects, I **thrive** on the process of making and learning.

### -Passion-
I have a **passion** for learning about computer science and aspire to become **a tech guru**.

Driven by my love for Minecraft, I've dabbled in creating Forge **mods**.

I have a keen **interest** in stunning and beautiful **animations**, and this passion can be glimpsed through my personal blog, which features some "simple" animations.

### -The page seems better with these meaningless sub headings :D-
Additionally, I'm an **enthusiast** of electronic circuits and astronomy.

I cherish my simple yet fulfilling life and enjoy setting goals for myself and continuously striving to **achieve** them.

Yes, this is me, **MakerTechno**.
